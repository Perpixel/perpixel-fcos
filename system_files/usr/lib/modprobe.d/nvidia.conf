## Nouveau must be blacklisted here as well beside from the initrd to avoid a

## Make a soft dependency for nvidia-uvm as adding the module loading to
## /usr/lib/modules-load.d/nvidia-uvm.conf for systemd consumption, makes the
## configuration file to be added to the initrd but not the module, throwing an
## error on plymouth about not being able to find the module.
## Ref: /usr/lib/dracut/modules.d/00systemd/module-setup.sh

## Even adding the module is not the correct thing, as we don't want it to be
## included in the initrd, so use this configuration file to specify the
## dependency.

## Preserve all video memory allocations
## This changes the default video memory save/restore strategy to save and restore all video memory allocations.
## Also, the /proc/driver/nvidia/suspend power management mechanism (with a system management tool, such as systemd)
## is required for using this interface.
